## What is a custom connector?

Cyclr's <a href="http://cyclr.com/connectors">connector store</a> provides connectors for many popular cloud apps, but you can also create your own connectors by uploading a simple text file. These connectors are private to your account.

### Why create a custom connector?

* An app we haven't added to our connector store yet (or one with some extra functionality)
* Connect your own custom or proprietary apps.

### What can I connect?

If your app or website has a publicly available REST API then we're in business.
