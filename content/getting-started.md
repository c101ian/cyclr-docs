## Step 1: Connect your apps 

Before you can use Cyclr you need to connect at least two of the apps that you're using for your business. Whether you wish to connect your CRM to your email marketing, your billing to your accounts, or anything else, you should head to Cyclr's Connector Store to find the connectors you need.

A connector -- when installed and authorised -- allows Cyclr to connect to your apps to sync data and trigger actions.

### Install some connectors

- On the top navigation bar, click Connector Store.
- In the Connector Store, locate the app you wish to connect and then click the install button.
- On the install screen, provide the appropriate authorisation

## Step 2: Start automating

Cycles are created in our builder. They can be as simple as synchronising data between two apps, or much more complex: for example, a workflow spanning many steps, many apps, and including logic (branching and delays).

### Create a cycle

- On the top navigation bar, click Cycles and the at the top of the screen click New. You will be now in the builder. 
- Give your cycle a name by clicking the default name at the top.
- In the right-hand menu, click the name of a connector you wish to use.
- The open connector will show a list of the available methods (things that Cyclr can trigger); click/hold to drag one onto the builder (for example, getting some contacts from your CRM system).
- When you drop a method into the builder, it creates a step.
- Click the cog button on the step to configure it.
- Click another connector and choose an appropriate method to follow (for example, adding contacts to your email marketing platform.)
- Click the dot on the right of the first step and connect it to your second step.
